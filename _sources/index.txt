pyFSRS - femtosecond stimulated Raman experiments made easy!
============================================================

pyFSRS is a modular GUI for pump-probe-type optical experiments, specialized for
femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy and transient-absorption spectroscopy.
However, it is not limited to these two applications and can be directly used for
any other pump-probe experiment without modification.

   Screenshot of the pyFSRS main window and a plot window used for cross-correlation measurements.

The architecture of the program is modular and open, so that anyone can modify it according
to his/her needs.

.. note:: The documentation currently is somewhat rudimentary and I am continuously working on improving it.. Please bare with me :)
