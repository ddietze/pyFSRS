What is FSRS?
=============

"Femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) is an ultrafast nonlinear optical 
technique that provides vibrational structural information with high temporal (sub-50 fs)
precision and high spectral (sub-10 cmâˆ’1) resolution. Since the first full demonstration
of its capabilities approximately 15 years ago, FSRS has evolved into a mature technique
giving deep insights into chemical and biochemical reaction dynamics that would be
inaccessible with any other technique. It is now being routinely applied to virtually
all possible photochemical reactions and systems spanning from single molecules in
solution to thin-films, bulk crystals and macromolecular proteins.

Traditionally, FSRS is a three-pulse experiment. An actinic pump pulse excites the
molecule in the usual way and initiates the photochemical reaction. The instantaneous
structure of the molecule, represented by its Raman spectrum, is then read out at
various time delays by a sequence of a narrowband Raman pump pulse and a broadband
probe pulse. The latter creates a macroscopic polarization with high time precision
giving rise to a free induction decay, which is measured with high energy resolution
by a dispersed detection system." (Dietze and Mathies, in preparation)

If you are interested in the technique and its technology, I recommend the
following two papers as a starting point:

    * McCamant et al., *Appl. Spectrosc.* **57**, 1317 (2003).
    * McCamant et al., *Rev. Sci. Instrum.* **75**, 4971 (2004).
